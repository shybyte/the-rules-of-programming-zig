Zig Example Programms for the book "The Rules of Programming" https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-rules-of/9781098133108/ based on the C++ examples from https://github.com/the-rules-of-programming/examples

## Rule 1 - As Simple as Possible, but No Simpler

[Count Bits](./01_simplicity/section_01_count_bits.zig)

### Measuring Simplicity

- How much code is written
- How many ideas are introduced
- How much time it takes to explain

### ... But no Simpler

[Count Step Pattern](./01_simplicity/section_02_steps.zig)

### Sometimes It's Better to Simplify the Problem Rather then the Solution

### Simple Algorithms

[Shuffle](./01_simplicity/section_03_shuffle.zig)

### Don't Lose the plot

### One Rule to Rule Them All
